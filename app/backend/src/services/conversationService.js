 *
 * In the full build, replace getAIReply() with a real LLM call:
 *   - OpenAI: openai.chat.completions.create(...)
 *   - Amazon Bedrock: BedrockRuntimeClient + InvokeModelCommand
 *
 * The agent uses only verified catalogue information for product claims.
 * If current information is unavailable, it asks the user to check the
